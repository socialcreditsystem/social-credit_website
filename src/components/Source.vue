            The data has been retreived with an
            <b>online survey</b> conducted between February and April 2018 with 2,209 respondents across China. Additionally, fifteen
            <b>semi-structured interviews</b> were conducted with SCS users during March and July 2018 in Beijing and Shanghai.
          </p>

          <p class="section__paragraph">
            The study tries to investigate the following aspects:
            <br>1. Document the overall
            <b>level of citizensâ€™ (non-)approval</b> of different SCSs
            <br>2. Identify the
            <b>underlying factors</b> that drive variations in approval of SCSs
          </p>

          >In the study, the participants were informed that the data would be anonymised. Nevertheless, the question arises as to whether the participants actually expressed their personal opinions. The effect on the studys results is considered marginal by the author.</p>
